<p><font face="lusitana" size="4px" color="#000000">More than one year of isolation and financial struggles has led artists and art promoters to reconsider, reimagine and redefine their practice;<br>bedroom-live-streaming-virtual-raves-plague-raves-bandcamp-friday-anxiety-NFTs-remote-lessons-paid-online-exhibitions-free-download-my-demo-shouldIgetanormaljob?<br>
“Recent events have completely exposed the <b>limits of individual agency</b>, creating a powerful demand for squad-based forms of resiliency” ¹, especially online; the time has now come to push the boundaries of togetherness, surpassing outdated structures to improve our action in <i>meatspace.</i></p>

  <br><br>
<p><p><b>Wassup in London? 🗓️ </b><br>
Today, whilst many venues offer their spaces for DIY events, few grassroots organisations have the resources to hold a night at an established club, and housing conceptual work within entertainment venues does not allow <b>artistic risk-taking</b>. Despite being aware of the hardship that some earnest community-oriented venues have been through, we believe that their typical financial demands (like £500+ rent and 2K-minimum-bar-spend) don't facilitate the creation of the right environment for mainstream-challenging and forward-thinking ideas to flourish. We think we shouldn't have to be “trendy” or “popular” to experiment with art, and that we shouldn’t be chronically dependent on government funding. Also, fuck “business-risk”, <b>we want to have fun and feel safe</b>.

<p><font face="lusitana" size="4px" color="#000000"><b>We believe the solution is a dedicated and sustainable space</b>, operated through a decision-making process that implements a democratized and transparent protocol from its inception.<br><br>
<b>Artists, musicians, DJs, producers, coders, songwriters, promoters, hackers, partygoers</b>: we call on you to join us in building a community drawn together from our ecosystem, with the goal of developing<b> a governance model for a collectively operated venue sustained by affordable monthly subscriptions</b>.<br>
Granting access to the decision-making process and allowing the members to freely make use of the space, we will shift the model from industry-oriented or curatorial (top-down 👎) to radically cooperational (bottom-up 👍).</p>
<br>

<p>Through meetings, workshops, panels and parties, we aim to<br><br>
    </p></div>

  <p><b>create the community</b><span class="tooltip"> <sup>(?)</sup><span class="tooltip-text">Our first goal is to bring together 200 subscribers who will pay a monthly fee of £20-to-40 for a year, to be able to cover together a 4-to-8k pcm rent; the actual figures will be discussed in the process.</span></span></p>⤥
<p><b>answer the key questions</b><span class="tooltip"><sup> (?)</sup><span class="tooltip-text">How can 200+ people make decisions together? How can we be inclusive and accessible? How do we deal with licenses and other legal shit? Will we become a coop or what? Why don’t we just squat an abandoned warehouse? This, and much more, is what the meetings and workshops will be about.</span></span></p>⤦
<p><b>apply this model to a space in London</b><span class="tooltip"><sup> (?)</sup><span class="tooltip-text">It won’t be easy to find a viable space that feels right; we nevertheless think it has to be part of the process. This will allow us to question the meaning of our action and the impact it will have in a determined area.</span></span></p>

<div id="post">By hinging our action on the principles of <b>solidarity economy</b> and <b>decentralized governance</b>, we want to bring together the scene’s stakeholders to contribute directly and cohesively to the post-isolation resurgence. 🤝<br>
  By hybridizing IRL and online participation, we aim to create a set of tools for self-management that overcome outmoded standards and offer a more accessible, functional and forward-thinking model of organisation. 🔥<br><br>
    Let’s create a “<b>network of networks</b>”, a “<b>team of teams</b>”, where groups and solo practitioners come together to empower one another by sharing a space, resources and knowledge, with the idea that self-determination must be established through mutual support. We have the moral duty to reimagine how our scene can work in a more sustainable, collaborative and accessible way: <b>let’s go back to the physical world, back to <i>intimacy</i>, but not back to <i>normalcy</i>; let’s challenge the “music industry” myth, and replace it with a new, humanist paradigm.</b>

  <b>OK but why?</b><br>
<p><font face="lusitana" size="4px" color="#000000"><p>Instead of falling back on existing models like for-profit music venues or studios/art spaces for rent, which exist in an atomised way, our project proposes a new approach based on <b>collaboration and interdependence.</b> ²<br>
  A <b>membership-based community</b> allows event organisers focussed on <b>experimental music</b> to take more risks without compromising their financial stability. This encourages long-term thinking as to programming choices, allowing promoters to be artistically ambitious.  <br>
  Artists from different groups meet and develop new projects together, with a bigger and more solid organisation to support them; new cultural value is created and shared with the community, which directly benefits from it; members of the local community are involved, finding <b>a new sense of agency</b>.<br>
  Steering away from competition and other neoliberal dogmas, we will move from the extemporaneity of disconnected one-off events and small-scale projects, and on to the consistency of structured collaboration. Big squad energy!<br>
  A <b>collective decision-making protocol</b>, if implemented with a clear rejection of majoritarianism ³, will create a genuinely inclusive and accessible environment where voices usually underrepresented or considered “fringe” will be heard, and their ideas brought to the forefront of the debate. <br>
  We will make mistakes, but we will never fuck up! Our collective praxis will adjust along with our shared experience.<br>
 “Teams are effective because they trust each other and they have a shared purpose” ⁴; a “team of teams” will serve as a superpowered support structure to allow all of us to pursue our own goals (“Solidarity without similarity” 💪 ). ⁵<br><br>
<i>Also, we have a soundsystem and we are not afraid to use it</i>. ⁶

  <b>I am / My team is interested! What now?</b><br>
  <p>We are applying for public funding to support the initial phase, while also raising funds ourselves through a series of initiatives.<br>
 Through meetings, workshops and parties, we can lay out a set of shared rules and best practices and run a small-scale collaboration experiment: if we get funding, we will organise a “<b>meeting zero</b>” and get the participants to decide how to use <i>part</i> of the grant budget together<span class="tooltip"><sup> (?)</sup><span class="tooltip-text">“part of it” because someone must have already paid what’s needed to organise the first meeting and anything else before that, right? 🤡</span></span>, to orientate the process towards shared goals from the outset.<br><br>
 This is where we got so far; we have many other ideas, but we want to hear from you now. What could be done or said differently/better?<br>
  The grant application has not yet been submitted and we want to know if you’d like to be involved and to what extent. You can be a part of the group of applicants, or join us later on.<br>
We have thought of friends, partners and collaborators, but we want you to bring others on board, so that there’s enough of us to support the initiative when it goes public. </p></div><br>
